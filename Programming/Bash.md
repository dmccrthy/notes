The "Bourne Again Shell" (or simply Bash) is a Scripting Language and [[Shell]]. As implied by the name, Bash was created as an improvement on the earlier [[Bourne Shell]] (sh) which itself was used as the basis for the [[POSIX Shell]]. If your interested in some of the actual differences between the two there is a brief overview in the GNU Bash docs here: https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Major-Differences-From-The-Bourne-Shell.html.
