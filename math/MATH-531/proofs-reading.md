# MATH 531: Proofs Reading

## Section 0: Communicating Mathematics

### Intro

-   Proofs are the basis for most regular math.
-   This book will teach you proofs

### 0.2 Symbol Best Practices

-   Don't start sentences with symbols
-   Try not to list symbols in your writing (avoid x, y, z, etc.)
-   Avoid using math symbols outside of there application
-   Try not to use i.e or e.g if you have variables with those letters
-   Write out integers in words if they aren't applicable to an equation.
-   Try not to mix symbols, where you could just write it out.
-   Explain what a symbol is when used (ex. x is a rational number)
-   Be consistent with the symbols/variables you use.

### 0.5 Writing Equations

When we write equations in our proofs we will typically add a line break and center the equation. If we need multiple lines we can do that. **Make sure the = signs are lined up**.

```
Bac,
    x = 1 + 2 + 3
      = 3 + 3
      = 6
```

### 0.6 Common Words

I, We, One, Lets - Avoid I. You really only use **We, or Lets**

-   Avoid Clearly, Obviously, Of Course, or Certainly (these make assumptions)
-   That, Which (Sometimes interchangeable)
