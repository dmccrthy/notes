# MATH 531: Proofs Definitions

## Terminology

**bac** - "by a calculation"

**ifc** - "it follows that"

**... dots** - "therefore"

## Def. - Rational

A real number x is called _rational_ if:

$x = \frac{m}{n}$

Where m & n are integers, and n =/ 0.

## Def. - Integer Operations

The sum, difference, or product of 2 integers is **also an integer**.

## Def. - Even/Odd

An integer is _odd_ if **n = 2k + 1**

An integer is _even_ if **n = 2k**

Where **k is an integer**

## Def. - Set

## Def. - Null/Empty Sets

The null/empty set is the set having **no elements**.

It is represented with this symbol: $\emptyset$

## Def. - Common Sets

**These are the definitions for very common sets/symbols:**

Big N - natural

Big Z - integers

Big Q - Rational

Q = {x of R: x = m/n where m of Z and n of Z, n =/ 0 }

Big R - Real

## Def. - Subsets

Let A and B be sets.

A is a subset of B.

$A \subseteq B$

Every $x \in A$ obeys $x \in B$

#

This also means that:

$A \subsetneq B$

Which mean there is SOME x that DOES NOT obey $x \in B$

## Def. - Set Equality

A and B are 2 sets.

We say A and B are equal.

if $A \subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq A$

This can be represented with

## Def. - Empty Set Theorem

Let A be a set.

Then, $\emptyset \subseteq A$
